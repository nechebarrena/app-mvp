# Physical Parameters Configuration
#
# This file contains the physical parameters used for metrics calculation.
# Adjust these values according to the actual setup being analyzed.
#
# These parameters are used to convert pixel measurements to real-world units
# and to calculate physical quantities like energy and power.

# Athlete measurements
athlete_height_m: 1.75      # Athlete height in meters (for future scale reference)

# Disc (plate) specifications
disc_diameter_m: 0.45       # Standard Olympic disc diameter = 45cm = 0.45m
disc_weight_kg: 20.0        # Weight of ONE disc in kg (e.g., 20kg plate)

# Barbell specifications  
bar_weight_kg: 20.0         # Standard Olympic bar = 20kg

# Configuration
num_discs: 2                # Number of discs on EACH side of the bar
                            # Total plates = 2 * num_discs (both sides)
                            # Example: num_discs=2 means 2 plates per side = 4 total

# Physical constants
gravity: 9.81               # Gravitational acceleration (m/s²)

# =============================================================================
# NOTES:
#
# Total Weight Calculation:
#   total_weight = bar_weight_kg + (2 * num_discs * disc_weight_kg)
#   
#   Example with defaults:
#   total_weight = 20 + (2 * 2 * 20) = 20 + 80 = 100 kg
#
# Scale Reference:
#   The disc_diameter_m is used as the reference for pixel-to-meter conversion.
#   We measure the disc radius in pixels from the manual selection, then:
#   
#   scale_m_per_px = (disc_diameter_m / 2) / radius_px
#
# Common Disc Weights (Olympic):
#   - 25 kg (red)
#   - 20 kg (blue)
#   - 15 kg (yellow)
#   - 10 kg (green)
#   - 5 kg (white)
#   - 2.5 kg (red small)
#   - 1.25 kg (various)
